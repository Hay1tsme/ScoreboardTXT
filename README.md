# ScoreboardTXT
## Description
### An easy-to-use, text-based scoreboard for OBS
OBS Text sources are clunky when constantly editing them to update names or scores for tournaments. ScoreboardTXT introcudes a simple GUI solution to this. It loads player and caster names from a text file, and outputs the ones you select, including their score, to seperate text files, one per player and one per caster.

## Installation
Simply download the zip from the release page, unzip them all to a folder, and launch the jar. Players.txt and casters.txt contain the list of casters and players. P1, p2, c1, and c2 are the players and casters selected. Player names are formatted as {Player} - {Score}.

## System Requirements
+ Java 11
+ Honestly if you can stream you can run this it's super tiny
